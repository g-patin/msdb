## What is this package about ?

This package has been designed for users that perform scientific analyses on materials. It aims to provide a generic working environment that can be used to store information about the objects, the materials, the analytical methods, the users, etc. The idea is to have a central location - a folder on your computer - that contains several databases files (.txt and .csv files) from which information can be easily retrieved and connected to analytical data. This package aims to support the creation and management of such database environment.   


## What does this package provide ?

The package provides two main resources:

- **database files**: create txt and csv files to store any relevant information regarding your analytical tasks.

- **CRUD functions**: a set of functions to create, read, update, and delete the content of the database files.

	

## Website structure

 The documentation follows the structure described by [Daniele Procida](https://diataxis.fr/), which organizes documentation into four different groups (Tutorials, How-to, Explanations, References).
